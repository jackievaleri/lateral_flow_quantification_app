# Lateral Flow Quantification App
Lateral flow signal quantification app for detecting organ transplantation rejection.

### Abstract
Infection and rejection are major causes of graft loss in organ transplantation and are linked by the net state of immunosuppression. Refined strategies to monitor transplanted patients are needed to diagnose and treat these conditions earlier in order to improve long-term outcomes.  Here, we show that CRISPR-Cas13 enables fast, low-cost, sensitive point-of-care detection of BK polyomavirus DNA, cytomegalovirus DNA and CXCL9 mRNA, allowing efficient monitoring of common opportunistic viral infections and rejection post-transplantation. BK virus and cytomegalovirus were detected from patient-derived blood and urine samples with high sensitivity and specificity. Similarly, CXCL9 mRNA was detected at elevated levels in urine samples from patients experiencing acute renal transplant rejection. The assay was also adapted for lateral flow read-out, enabling simple visualization and interpretability of results. This work demonstrates the potential for CRISPR-Cas13 diagnostics to facilitate point-of-care post-transplantation monitoring.
